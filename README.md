Friend suggestion system using BFS

This project is an implementation of a Friend Suggestion System using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm in C++. The system recommends friends to users based on their connections, similar to features found on social networking platforms

What is BFS?
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root (or an arbitrary node in the case of a graph) and explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of nodes to be explored next.

Why Use BFS?
BFS is particularly suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which makes it ideal for friend suggestion systems. In the context of a social network, BFS can efficiently traverse the network to discover potential friends within a certain degree of separation, ensuring that the suggestions are relevant and based on the shortest connection path between users.
